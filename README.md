# Gesture-Detection-for-Locking-and-Unlocking

## Objective

Using Arduino Uno and an accelerometer (MPU-6050), detect and record a sequence of hand motions. Save this sequence as the key sequence that will be used when attempting to check whether a successful unlock is completed. Attempts will then be made to replicate the key sequence within sufficient tolerances to unlock the resource. A successful unlock is indicated by a visual indication, such as an LED or displays on screen (serial monitor).
